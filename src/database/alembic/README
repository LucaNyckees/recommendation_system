# DB versioning: alembic

The database structure is versioned using [alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/index.html).

Alembic configuration file is `recommendation_system/alembic.ini`.


Versions are stored in `recommendation_system/src/database/alembic/versions`. A version file contains mainly:
* `revision` version number
* `down_revision` prior version number
* `upgrade()` contains instructions to get from the prior version to this version.
* `downgrade()` contains instructions to get from this version to the prior version.

## Commands
`alembic` has to be run inside the `recommendation_system` directory.

`alembic --help` will display help.


### DB selection
Alembic is connected either to the default DB specified in `config.toml` 
or to a given DB if you use the following option: `-x db=db_name`, e.g.
```
alembic -x db=db_1 current 
```


### Information
* `alembic current [--verbose]` prints the current version.
* `alembic history [--verbose]` prints the history of versions.

### New version

* `alembic revision -m "version_name"` creates a new empty version file.
* `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "version_name"` autogenerates a new version file. It compares a given MetaData
  (`target_metadata` in `env.py`) to the current structure of the DB. It then proposes version file, it has to be checked
  because autodetection is not perfect.

### Merge
`alembic merge Revision_ID_1 Revision_ID_2 -m "merge Revision_ID_1 Revision_ID_2"`

### Migration
`alembic upgrade|downgrade version` migrates the db to the specified `version`. It can be:
* `head` or `base` for `upgrade` or `downgrade`, respectively
* `+x` or `-x` for `upgrade` or `downgrade`, respectively, `x` being the relative number of versions from current version.
* absolute version number e.g. `4c90abe1f75f`, it can be shortened to the first few characters as long as it uniquely identifies a version.
